# TSP_using_OpenGL

TSP or Traveling Salesperson Problem is "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?". The problem statement is that, the points are the cities a salesperson might visit. The salesmanâ€™s goal is to keep both the travel costs and the distance travelled as low as possible. Rather than focus on finding the most effective route, TSP is often concerned with finding the cheapest solution. In TSPs, the large amount of variables creates a challenge when finding the shortest route, which makes approximate, fast and cheap solutions all the more attractive.     

**OpenGL**   
   
Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering. The OpenGL specification describes an abstract API for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. Although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software, it is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely in hardware. The API is defined as a set of functions which may be called by the client program, alongside a set of named integer constants (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the decimal number 3553). Although the function definitions are superficially similar to those of the programming language C, they are language-independent.   
   
**GLUT**   
   
GLUT is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs. It implements a simple windowing application programming interface (API) for OpenGL. It makes it considerably easier to learn about and explore OpenGL programming. GLUT provides a portable API so you can write a single OpenGL program that works across all PC and workstation OS platforms. It is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs. While GLUT is well-suited to learning OpenGL and developing simple OpenGL applications, it is not a full-featured toolkit so large application requiring sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system toolkits. GLUT is simple, easy, and small.   
   
   When the number of cities is specified and the cost matrix is given, it calculates and shows the movement of object (referred as salesperson) from one city to another along with the display of best path and minimum cost.
